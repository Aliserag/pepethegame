# DEGEN Mode Implementation Guide

## Overview
DEGEN Mode is a play-to-earn game mode where players pay $5 to enter and compete for a prize pool with exponential rewards based on score and speed.

## Economics Model

### Entry & Fees
- **Entry Fee**: $5 USD (0.002 ETH at $2500 ETH price)
- **Creator Fee**: 5% ($0.25 per entry)
- **Prize Pool**: 95% ($4.75 per entry)
- **Daily Limit**: 1 play per wallet per 24 hours

### Reward Formula
```
Your Reward = (Your Score / High Score) √ó Pool √ó Speed Multiplier
```

**Capped at 50% of total pool to prevent drainage**

### Speed Multiplier (DEGEN Mode Only)
- Base: 1.0x (100 basis points)
- Increases 0.1x every 2.5 points (2x faster than Fun Mode)
- Formula: `100 + (score √ó 4)` basis points

**Examples:**
- Score 10: 1.4x multiplier
- Score 25: 2.0x multiplier
- Score 50: 3.0x multiplier
- Score 100: 5.0x multiplier

### Anti-Gaming Mechanics
1. **Minimum Threshold**: Must score ‚â•80% of day's high score to earn anything
2. **Max Payout Cap**: 50% of total pool
3. **Daily Verification**: On-chain timestamp prevents multi-play
4. **Rollover**: 20% of unclaimed pool carries to next day

## Smart Contract

### Contract: `FlowPepeDegen.sol`
Location: `/contracts/FlowPepeDegen.sol`

### Key Functions

#### For Players:
```solidity
// Pay entry fee and start game
function enterGame() external payable

// Submit score after game ends
function submitScore(uint256 score) external

// Calculate potential reward
function calculateReward(address player, uint256 day) public view returns (uint256)

// Claim rewards from previous days
function claimReward(uint256 day) external

// Check if played today
function hasPlayedToday(address player) public view returns (bool)

// Get current prize pool
function getCurrentPool() external view returns (uint256)
```

#### For Owner:
```solidity
// Withdraw accumulated creator fees
function withdrawCreatorFees() external onlyOwner

// Update entry fee
function setEntryFee(uint256 newFee) external onlyOwner
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Early Player Advantage
**Day 1, 10 players, $50 pool**
- Player A scores 50 (high score, 3.0x multiplier)
  - Base reward: $50 (100% of high score)
  - With multiplier: $50 √ó 3.0 = $150
  - **Capped at $25** (50% of pool)
- Player B scores 40 (80%, 2.6x multiplier)
  - Base reward: $40
  - With multiplier: $40 √ó 2.6 = $104
  - **Capped at $25**
- Players C-J score below threshold: $0
- **Rollover to Day 2**: $10 (20% of $50)

### Scenario 2: Competitive Day
**Day 5, 50 players, $250 pool**
- Player A scores 100 (high score, 5.0x multiplier)
  - Base reward: $250
  - With multiplier: $250 √ó 5.0 = $1,250
  - **Capped at $125** (50% of pool)
- Player B scores 95 (95%, 4.8x multiplier)
  - Base reward: $237.50
  - With multiplier: $1,140
  - **Capped at $125**
- Player C scores 80 (80%, 4.2x multiplier)
  - Reward: ~$50
- Players below 80 threshold: $0
- Total paid: ~$200, Rollover: $50

### Scenario 3: Rollover Accumulation
**Week 2, daily rollovers building up**
- Base pool: $500 from entries
- Rollover from previous day: $100
- **Total available**: $600
- High scorer can win up to $300 (50% cap)

## UI Components

### Mode Selection Screen
Component: `ModeSelection.tsx`
- Fun Mode vs DEGEN Mode selection
- Clear explanation of each mode
- Visual distinction (blue vs green)

### DEGEN Mode Features (To Be Implemented)
1. **Entry Flow**:
   - Show current prize pool
   - Show players today
   - Confirm $5 payment
   - Transaction approval

2. **During Game**:
   - Live multiplier display
   - Potential earnings calculator
   - Current high score to beat

3. **Game Over**:
   - Final multiplier
   - Calculated reward
   - Claim button (if reward > 0)
   - Try again tomorrow if already played

## Game Mechanics Differences

### Fun Mode
- Speed multiplier: +10% every 5 points
- Unlimited plays
- Free to play
- Regular leaderboard

### DEGEN Mode
- Speed multiplier: +10% every 2.5 points (2x faster)
- 1 play per 24 hours
- $5 entry fee
- Prize pool rewards
- More challenging (faster speed increase)

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. Economic model design
2. Smart contract development
3. Mode selection UI
4. Anti-gaming mechanics
5. Daily reset system
6. Prize pool calculation
7. Rollover mechanism

### üöß In Progress
1. Mode selection integration
2. Game speed adjustment for DEGEN Mode
3. DEGEN contract interaction hook

### üìã Todo
1. Entry fee payment flow
2. Prize pool display UI
3. Earnings calculator
4. Game over flow for DEGEN Mode
5. Claim rewards UI
6. Contract deployment
7. Testing & audit

## Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy Contract** to Base Sepolia
2. **Verify Contract** on Basescan
3. **Fund Initial Pool** (optional seed)
4. **Update Frontend** with contract address
5. **Test with Test ETH**
6. **Launch** to mainnet

## Security Considerations

- ‚úÖ ReentrancyGuard on all money functions
- ‚úÖ Ownable for admin functions
- ‚úÖ No arbitrary external calls
- ‚úÖ Pull over push for payments
- ‚úÖ Time-based validation for daily plays
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs audit before mainnet**
